A file named puzzle.in will be read:
 -1st two number are w x h dimensions
 -next number is the type 1 = BFS, 2 = DFS
 -The next numbers are the tiles from left to right top to bottom 
  -with -1 as the blank

The given sample problem is seems to take long even with BFS

simple problems are given as an example in puzzle.in
program only read 1st problem, you can rearrange to read others

how to compile:
make will complile this

analysis:
 -BFS will find the shortest solution given there is one in a reasonable time compared to DFS
 -DFS can end up going down a long a fruitless route before it considers other path a given level
  -from the way my program is set up it will try moving
   various states' blank spot to the left, down, right, then up
    -it tries pushing those states in that prioirty to an extreme
  -even with skipping visited states DFS is not good with a large solution space
 

here is sample input:
3 3 2

1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8 -1

1  2  3
4  5  6
-1  7 8
and it's  output:
start
 1  2  3 
 4  5  6 
 7  8    

goal
 1  2  3 
 4  5  6 
    7  8 


steps
